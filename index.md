## About SismoFinder

`SismoFinder` is a simple wrapper around the configuration file of `Sismo`.
There are two major benefits when using SismoFinder as a replacement or addition to your Sismo configuration file.

* The actual project's configuration for a Sismo project is saved within the project itself.
  Thus there is no need to setup each new project within Sismo.
* The configuration for Sismo is shared among the collaborators of the project.
